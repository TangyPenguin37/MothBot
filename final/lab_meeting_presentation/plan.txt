background
Helicoverpa armigera - one of the worldâ€™s worst crop pests, recently invaded South America (2013)
hybridised w/ Helicoverpa zea and spread genes for resistance to Bt toxins
difficult to distinguish - can only be done by genotyping - already long process, but getting worse as species hybridise more
need to find a way to distinguish them in the field
idea - use machine learning model to distinguish them using only images of their wings

first step - get images - from gabby - easy!

second step - extract features
crop and separate wing and analyse using imagej
measure hue value of wing using imagej and split by threshold
find largest shape and measure (list features) and save to csv
use python to find shape and colour (explain efd and k-means) and add to csv - originally planned to use R but didnt work as well (issues with missing packages etc. + python more familiar)

first tried simple algorithms
tried logistic regression - accuracies ______ (73% multiclass - but redo with old data?)
tried LDA - change one line - accuracy _____
above values w/ confidence intervals/std

// LDA worse but then access to new data (Jacob) helped LDA improve to be better

stratified splits, cross validation (at least before full batch) helped improve performance

gave basic baseline for neural networks
then moved onto neural networks
first tried with csv - almost matching LDA - shows potential - show all values
then tried with images directly - didn't come as close (even w/ different architectures and pretrained model)

focusing on csv - made some optimisations

learning rate scheduler, early stopping, dropout, (//weight decay?), regularization, batch normalisation, different architectures, gradient clipping

all helped except dropout, regularization, gradient clipping - got to above 80% accuracy

normalising data helps a lot - training data only
learning rate scheduler helped to refine at the end - show tensorboard graph with drops 

LDA still isn't too far off - makes sense given assumption about normal distribution - show histogram of area and maybe other values

some issues - class imbalance and pseudoreplication

grouping - multiple samples for same individual - grouping by wing worked best - best would be to group all samples from same individual together, but limits size of dataset, so performance suffers
compromise - group by wings - still gives good performance, but allows for larger dataset
used with better splitting to avoid pseudoreplication across train/val sets

two types of baseline - zero rate and random rate
actual baseline - 0.72564789991^2+0.14030384271^2+0.13404825737^2 = 0.56421897822
balanced baseline = 0.3267

imbalance arguably better as majority class is more important to get right - fraud detection example
but balancing classes shows accuracy isnt just because of majority class - split 33% each class gives approx 65% accuracy (vs 57 for LDA)

accuracy arguably not the best metric - confusion matrix allows calculation of precision and recall (explain both)
shows precision and recall good for armigera, not so much for hybrids and zea
this isn't as bad as we want to detect armigera more often than zea - similar to fraud detection example
balancing classes causes precision and recall to be more similar across all classes - balance can be adjusted as needed to give desired precision and recall

overall - machine learning works, specifically best with a feed-forward neural network - whilst accuracy won't be perfect, it acts as an aid for farmers in the field, and could be improved with more data and further refinement

thanks to api and gabby and all for listening :)
